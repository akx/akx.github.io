# Hello.

I'm [@akx](https://github.com/akx) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/akx), [reddit](https://reddit.com/u/akx), [keybase](https://keybase.io/akx)),
a programmer generalist and general enthusiast from Finland.

I'm a founder/CTO/lead dev/sysadmin/startup tech hand at [Valohai](https://valohai.com/), the finest purveyor of
professional MLOps tools in the world.

I'm one of the maintainers of [Babel](https://github.com/python-babel/babel), an internationalization library for Python.

## My stuff

Here's a list of some of the open-source stuff I've done.

It most likely is not complete nor up-to-date.
You can always check [the repos page](https://github.com/akx?tab=repositories) for more,
and there's probably something interesting on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/akx) too.

Where things are tagged as "Release", it means the stuff has been successfully used in production,
or that I personally use that stuff at least semi-regularly. For stuff in other states of release, well â€“ your mileage may vary.
