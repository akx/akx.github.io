# Hello.

I'm [@akx](https://github.com/akx) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/akx), [reddit](https://reddit.com/u/akx), [keybase](https://keybase.io/akx)),
a programmer generalist and general enthusiast from Finland.

I'm one of the maintainers of [Babel](https://github.com/python-babel/babel), an internationalization library for Python.

## My stuff

Here's a list of some of the stuff I've done. 
It most likely is not complete nor up-to-date. You can always check [the repos page](https://github.com/akx?tab=repositories) for more. :)
